# INFO-H413 - Linear Ordering Problem Otpimization

## Description
This repository is about implementing multiple algorithms in order to optimize
the Linear Ordering Problem (LOP). This is part of the INFO-H413 - "Heuristic Optimization" Course.


## Usage

Two ways to execute the code:
1) One algorithm on a certain instance, by providing the specifications of the algorithm you want and the
instance you want to run directly as argument in the command line.
2) All algorithm of a kind on all instances, by running the `runner.py` python script and by providing the algorithm kind.


### One Algorithm, One Instance



### All Algorithms, All Instances
